## Synopsis

Happy Hour Planner is a service that enables automatic organization of a Happy Hour for friends and colleagues.  The code allows the set
up of a regular happy hour schedule.  It leverages the Yelp API to make suggestions for location.

## Motivation

Happy Hour planning is usually done through emails or through a calendar application.  Emails take too much time.  A calendar application
doesn't allow collaborative planning specific to a Happy Hour.

## Installation

The code is written to deploy easily to Google App Engine from Eclipse using the standard Google App Engine Eclipse plugin.

Eclipse can be downloaded from [here](https://eclipse.org/downloads/).

Instructions on installing the Google App Engine Eclipse plugin can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/eclipse/docs/appengine).
